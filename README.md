# Notes and Informations

Here you will find several notes I made during my Python studies, with the idea of making them easily accessible from anywhere to help me, if needed, or other people.

## Content:

<table align="center">
    <tr>

        </td>
        <td align="left">
            Examples of Python syntax for simple commands and information on data structures and how to manipulate them.
            It's simple content, but that's the idea, review to remember some syntax.
